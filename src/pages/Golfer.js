                                <p>
                                    Golf is a bonding experience between her boyfriend and father who has no other means of communication due to a language barrier. Since both men in her life are golfers, she thought picking up the sport herself would make them more incline to spend time with her. Little did she realize, that meant slaving away at the course on her rest days as either a caddy or the golf cart girl. One time, she voluntarily agreed to participate on a golf trip; which, to her amazement she found herself on a 36-holes course and a whole lot of muscle spasm by the end of it. While golfing can be fun, she feels she got promoted from mini golfing a little too fast for comfort.                </p>
