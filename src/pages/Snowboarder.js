                                Chloe Kim, the Winter Olympics gold medalist, served as an inspiration in 2019. Crystal ventured onto her first mountain in Big Bear Snow Summit. To her surprise, she was oblivious to her friends who lured her down a blue despite never having boarded before. Crystal braced herself for her first run with a lack of understanding for physics. It was a twisted tale full of falls, tailbone bruising, and even face plants that result in the loss of her phone. Thinking sheâ€™ll forever be trapped atop the mountain, she broke down in tears. After an episode of her mental breakdown, Crystal muster the courage to try again in which she succeed to get down the slope smoothly. Falling in love with snowboarding, she finds herself booking a snow trip any chance the California mountain tips appear white.
